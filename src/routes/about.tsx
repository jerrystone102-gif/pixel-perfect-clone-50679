          <p>Nedd Digital works across two areas that are usually kept apart: keeping your finances clear, and building the digital tools your business depends on. We think that split is a mistake. The person who understands your numbers should be talking to the person building your systems, because the two are almost always connected.</p>
          <p>Most of the businesses we work with don't need more software. They need their existing numbers to be right, their reports to answer the question they actually asked, and their day to day work to take less effort than it currently does. That's the whole job, really.</p>
